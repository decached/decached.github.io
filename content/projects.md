#### **Personal and Academic Projects**

##### [![github-icon][github-icon]][taylr] [Taylr - Personal Assistant for Interview Preparation][taylr]
*Python, Twilio, IBM Alchemy*  
*Taylr* was a winning hack my team built at HackBU 2017. It helps users horn
their interview skills by helping them understand their mistakes and get better
at interviewing. Enter some quick questions about the type of interview you'd
like to test out, your name and phone number and get a call from *Taylr*, our
interviewer. *Taylr* will ask you a set of questions which you will answer in
real time. Following the interview, *Taylr* will send you a link to view a
dashboard in a simple, sleek and responsive UI to view in-depth analytics about
your speech and sentiment.

##### [![github-icon][github-icon]][konoha] [Konoha - Theme for Hugo][konoha]
*HTML, CSS, Markdown*  
Konoha is a minimalistic personal website theme for Hugo. 

#### **Open Source Contributions**

##### [![github-icon][github-icon]][zulip] [Zulip - Open Source Group Chat][zulip]
*Go, Python*  
Zulip is a powerful open source team chat server. I've made a couple of
contributions. I've integrated webhooks for Gogs which is a painless self-hosted
Git service. I've also added a few Fixes to enable `--strict-optional` check
when running mypy. Currently, I'm implementing Go bindings for Zulip API.
