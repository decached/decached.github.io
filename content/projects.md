### **Open Source Contributions**

##### [![github-icon][github-icon]][zulip] [Zulip - Open Source Group Chat][zulip]
Tech: *Go, Python*  
Zulip is a powerful open source team chat server. I've made a couple of
contributions. I've integrated webhooks for Gogs which is a painless self-hosted
Git service. I've also added a few Fixes to enable `--strict-optional` check
when running mypy. Currently, I'm implementing Go bindings for Zulip API.
